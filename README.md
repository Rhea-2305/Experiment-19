# Experiment-19
## Aim
To study and implement Queue implementation using an array.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
A queue is a linear data structure that operates on the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first to be removed. Queues are commonly used in applications like task scheduling, managing server requests, and buffering data streams.

Key Queue Operations:
- Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
- Dequeue: Remove an element from the front.
- Front: View the front element without removing it.
- Rear: View the element at the back.
- isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
- isFull: Check if the queue is full (for fixed-size queues).

## Conclusion
We learned about Queueing and implemented it in C++.
